# web-practice

This is the repo where I put all the mini projects I use to learn front-end (be it js logic or css designs).
Please note that I'm just getting started in the world of front-end development, so the code & logic you see here might not be the best way to proceed.

Note that you might find plag here, since I am mostly following some yt video or a random repo.

### Things I plan to add here (not in order):

- [ ] todo list
- [x] calculator
- [x] tic tac toe
- [x] cool popup
- [ ] snake game
- [x] random quote generator
- [ ] login/signup form with validation

Thank You :)
